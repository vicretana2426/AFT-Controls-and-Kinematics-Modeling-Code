This file will contain our current goals and the state of the desing process at any given point in time
it is good to always write our goals down and stick to them

As of 3/3/2024 the AFT aims to desing a drone which can take off and land automously

In order to develop this we must have a working method of simulating our drone and how the code we 
integrate affects flight paths.

The current goal is that we will give the drone two lines to follow, one that goes up x feet and one that
goes down x feet. 

( In the future we will have more complicated flight paths, but the process is still the same: getting the drone to fly along a given line)

Current tasks are as follows:

1. Standardize the meaning of a drone object
2. Develop a kinematics modeling software which measures position and orientation over time
   ( the first run of the software will use constant thurst conditions )
3. Develop or find general preliminary controls software
    ( we will need to model this software )
4. integrate
